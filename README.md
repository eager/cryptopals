# Cryptopals

Challenges from [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/).

This is also a project for getting more familar with [Go](https://go.dev). It’s probably not idiomatic and doesn’t make good use of modules.

## Notes

### Set 1

- To run challenge 4, do `go run shared.go 4.go`
- To test challenge 6, do `go test 6.go 6_test.go`. To run challenge 6, do `go run shared.go 6.go`	

### Set 2

- To run a challenge, do `go run github.com/eager/cryptopals/set2 <challenge number>`, e.g. `go run github.com/eager/cryptopals/set2 12`
